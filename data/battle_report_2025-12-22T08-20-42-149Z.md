## Notes
- Salvage generation is proportional to casualties; amounts are pseudo-random per round.
- Citadel ruins chance is based on total casualties proportion and includes a RNG factor.

If you'd like different salvage weights, a different ruin probability formula, or per-hit damage logs, I can re-run and save results accordingly.
