## Notes
- Unit model used: `Militia` — hp=20, attack=6, defense=2 (simulator default).
- The simulator logs per-round remaining counts and number of units killed that round. Per-hit damage details are not included in the JSON; if you want per-hit damage totals, I can re-run the simulator to record per-round damage sums.

## Next steps
- Re-run with custom unit stats or army sizes: `node server/battle_simulator.js` supports editing the script to change defaults or we can add CLI args.
- Batch runs / CSV export: I can add a runner to produce multiple simulations and CSV output if you'd like.
